# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
This repository contains Python implementation of Data Structures, Algorithms and Problems that can be used for sharpening coding skills for Software Engineering Interviews.

Most of the problems organized in files by topics. In notebooks one can find problems with Leetcode numbers and some useful links to solve the problem.

- *CrackingTheCodinglnterview Problems.ipynb* - solutions for the task from "Cracking The Coding lnterview".
- *Data Structures.ipynb* - implementation of common datastructures.
- *Sorting-Algos.ipynb* - sorting algorithms, their pros and cons, useful resources:
    1. Bubble Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Quick Sort
    5. Merge Sort
    6. Merge Sort vs Quick Sort
- *graphs.ipynb* - basic graph algorithms:
    1.Breadth First Search (BFS)
    2. Depth Dirst Search (DFS)
    3. Dijkstras Algorithm
