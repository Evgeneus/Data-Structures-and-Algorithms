# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
This repository contains Python implementation of Data Structures, Algorithms and Problems that can be used for sharpening coding skills for Software Engineering Interviews.

Most of the problems organized in files by topics. In notebooks one can find problems with Leetcode numbers and some useful links to solve the problem.

- *CrackingTheCodinglnterview Problems.ipynb* contains solutions for the task from "Cracking The Coding lnterview".
- *Data Structures.ipynb* contains implementation of common datastructures.
- *Sorting-Algos* contains sorting algorithms
